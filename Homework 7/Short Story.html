           <span class="goodWriting"> When I was younger, about the age of 12. I had a closet in my bedroom, this closet had these little circular lights on the walls. The only way to turn them on, was by touching them with your hand, they were not motion activated, only by actually touching them would they turn on. So one night when I was sleeping I was woken up at about 2 in the morning. The light outside my bedroom had turned on, I fugured it was my brother just getting up to use the bathroom, that was until my eyes adjusted to the light, and I recognized that the lights were not coming from the hallway, but from my closet instead. I instantly popped up with adreneline running through my body, knowing that the only way they could have turned on why be do to something or someone actually physically touching them. I grabbed my metal water bottle and proceeded towards my closet as quitely as I could, I heard some sort of shuffling coming from inside. I flung open the doors, and began swinging...But it took me seconds to relize... The closet was empty...There was no one inside.</span>
